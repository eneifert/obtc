      Almost every household in Kyrgyzstan now has a computer and businesses are rapidly seeking to modernize. While the internet remains a vast untapped resource, many companies are taking advantage of the lack of competition and making a name for themselves. But where will the next generation of developers come from?<br><br>
      Enter the <strong>OBTC</strong>. In August of 2014 we hope to open a teaching center that will focus on raising up the business men and women who will be able to take advantage of this great opportunity.<br><br>
      We are still looking for potential investors, so if you would like to jump on board and help develop this important industry, fill out the contact form below             
  cashmere_main_html: |
      Kyrgyzstan has some of the best Cashmere in the world, but unfortunately the cashmere industry is not YET developed here so many families don't know how to properly collect their cashmre and the ones that do end up selling it for much less than it is worth. </br></br>
      Enter the <strong>OBTC</strong>. Our hope is to open a cashmere processing factory here in southern Kyrgyzstan. But first we need to develop clients to buy the cashmere and train the local shepherds on how to collect and improve the quaility of the cashmere even more!</br></br>

  english_main_html: |
      The English language is a highly sought skill as many here in Kyrgyzstan seek to do more business with the outside world. When someone learns English their chances of doing more business and earning a higher income raise drastically.</br></br>
      Enter the <strong>OBTC</strong>. Our goal is to help the English teachers here in Osh not only improve their own language skills but to also help them improve their ciriculums so that they will be able to better prepare their students for a rapidly modernizing world.</br></br>
