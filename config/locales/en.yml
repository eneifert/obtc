While the internet remains a vast untapped resource, many companies are taking advantage of the lack of competition and making a name for themselves. But where will the next generation of developers come from?<br><br>
      Enter the <strong>OBTC</strong>. In August of 2014 we hope to open a teaching center that will focus on raising up the business men and women who will be able to take advantage of this great opportunity.<br><br>

      Kyrgyzstan has some of the best Cashmere in the world, but unfortunately the cashmere industry is not YET developed here so many families don't know how to properly collect their cashmre and the ones that do end up selling it for much less than it is worth. </br></br>
      Enter the <strong>OBTC</strong>. Our hope is to open a cashmere processing factory here in southern Kyrgyzstan. But first we need to develop clients to buy the cashmere and train the local shepherds on how to collect and improve the quaility of the cashmere even more!</br></br>
